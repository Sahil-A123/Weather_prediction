# Project Overview

In this I will predict tomorrow's temperature using historical data. I will start by downloading a dataset of local weather. We can customize this to own location. Then, I will clean the data and get it ready for machine learning.
I build a system to make historical predictions. Then, I will add more predictors to improve the model and at the end with how to make next-day predictions.
